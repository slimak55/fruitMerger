## About the game
This game is created in GDevelop to try how the engine works, what it is capable of, and if it does all I need for my bigger projects.
Fruit Merger is a simple concept I try in game engines to test how things work, and work in GDevelop really simple to the point where I will try to add some more complex features, just to test what it possible.
It is also the first of my games that is in a functional state, and I am happy enough to publish it.

The game will be published on Itch.io, and you can see all of the assets here on GitHub, but I will not allow you to contribute, just to find issues, so I can fix them.
Also, all of the assets are handmade, or the license is in the repo. **You can use all of my original assets if you want but it is not allowed to redistribute the game itself without major gameplay and graphical changes.**
