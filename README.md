## About the game
This game is created in GDevelop to try how the engine works, what is is capable of, and if it does all I need for my bigger projects.
Fruit Merger is simple concept I try in game engines to test how things work, and work in GDevelop really simple to a point where I will try to add some more complex features, just to test what it possible.
It is also the first of my games that is in functional state, that I am happy enough with to publish it.

The game will be publish on Itch.io, and you can see all of the assets here on GitHub, but I will not allow you to contribute, just to find issues, so I can fix them.
Also, all of the assets are hand made, or the license is in the repo. **You can use all of my original assets if you want but it is not allowed to build or redistribute the game itself in any way other than downloading it from offical source.**
